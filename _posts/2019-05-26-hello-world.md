# Welcome

**Hello world**

I have created this blog to share my insight about computer security and penetration testing, as well as keeping my notes handy, perhaps together with some CTF writeups. Hope someone can take advantage of them as much as I do of various sources around the web. 

I've decided against CMS in favor of a static-site generator for easier deployment and less fuss concerning updates, maintenance and overall security. There is no database to breach :). And it's a good habit to use Github to keep stuff.

It also never hurts to know Markdown (or LaTeX for that matter :) ).

It was helpful to use a Docker [container](https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker/) to hold all the dependencies for local development.
